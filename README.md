# principles

- develop your pieces 1: control the center (pawns, knights, bishops)
- protect your king: castle early
- develop your pieces 2: connect your rooks

## material
- 1 - P
- 3 - B,N
- 5 - R
- 9 - Q

## tactics
- **pins** - have 2 aligned opponents pieces in line of sight, with the most value behind the other. the one in the middle is 'pinned'
- **skewers** - similar to pin, but the immediately attacked piece is the most valuable. it can be saved but you will capture the other one in that case
- **forks** - your piece is targetting multiple opponent cells, making it impossible to avoid capturing. knights are super effective forking
- **discovered attack** - moving one piece of ours results in another piece attacking opponent pieces (if a king, it's called **discovered check**)
